#A Week with Eigg Electric
##Saturday, am

‘Is it really that interesting to see the routes we take everyday,’ asks Jamie? 

Jamie is driving his pickup truck along a narrow tarmac road down the north west corner of the Isle of Eigg. His young daughter, Isla, is strapped in the back. A border collie is curled up in the passenger footwell. A couple of refurbished bikes are strapped to the back. 

Jamie is the newest member of the five person maintenance team, joining Eddie, Kenny, Bob and Jenny who take it in turns to carry out twice daily checks on the Isle of Eigg’s award winning renewable energy system. 

‘Every day one of us travels along the same road from our different houses to the same point, the control centre, to complete our checks’ Jamie says. ‘Can it really be that interesting?’

##Award Winning

The story of Eigg’s energy infrastructure - that combines wind, hydro and solar power to produce electricity without a connection to the UK’s mainland grid - is well known. The project is the subject of countless newspaper articles, magazine features, documentary films, blogs and books, and has won national awards for design and sustainability.

##Off the Grid?

Residents and visitors to Eigg need electricity. 

But the island’s wind turbines, hydro-electric turbines, solar panels, diesel generators, transformers and high voltage cables do not work on their own. 

Like infrastructure anywhere, the effectiveness of Eigg’s electricity system depends on relationships between people, technology and the environment.

The maintenance team keep the infrastructure operational. Contractors supply expert knowledge and parts. The collection of data helps to manage demand. Journalists help to raise the island’s profile. Visitors help to sustain the island’s economy. The system itself hinges on a complex relationship to the elements: wind, rain and sun.  

As one long term resident of Eigg puts it, ‘It’s not about whether or not you’re off the grid it’s about how you relate to what you need.’ 

The everyday journey's taken by the Eigg Electric team throw these relationships into sharp relief.

##Eigg's Electric Routes

Once a week the team meet at the main control centre, a well kept equipment shed next to a field of solar panels where energy is regulated and stored. The team take it in turns to carry out routine daily checks here every morning and evening. Some of them drive over, some cycle and some walk.

###### <iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/109571172?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=3a6774&amp;autoplay=0&amp;loop=1&amp;volume=0" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>


These journeys to and from the control centre are never only about electricity. They are seamlessly combined with other aspects of daily life. 

Like other members of the team Jamie’s trips are often combined with some other task, helping him save on fuel and journey times. He might drop pick somebody up or drop something off. A routine daily visit to the control centre, for example, might be combined with a delivery of groceries, tools, fuel, paint, firewood, infants, bikes or tourists fresh off the boat. 

The seasons change too, from the dark wet days of spring to the long dry days of summer. And, with each season the population of Eigg make different demands on their electricity system.

Over time there are physical changes in the system too, as shifting demands and constant use require the equipment to be fine tuned, repaired or replaced.

The four wind turbines that stand on the south side of Eigg, exposed to the south-westerly wind, have become iconic of the island’s green energy ambitions, as recognisable as [An Sgurr] (http://smallisles.wordpress.com/eigg/eigg-in-25-objects/]), the pitchstone ridge that defines the island’s shape and its name, Eilean Eige, or island of the notch. 

Each turbine is secured upright in place with high-tensile steel cables. Installing these under tension can be dangerous: if they come loose or are improperly secured they can be fired back along their line of trajectory, causing serious injury to anyone who were to be unfortunate enough to be in the way. 

Visitors to Eigg frequently ask for tours of the electricity system. For many, a day trip to the ‘windmills’ is a highlight of their trip. Sometimes the interest can get too much for the island’s residents. ‘Next time people want to take a picture of me in front of a wind turbine I’m going to tell them to hire a model,’ jokes John Booth, a retired member of the Eigg Electric team.  

Despite their prominence in the story of Eigg the four turbines produce only a fraction of the island’s energy. At six kilowatts each they generate less than half the electricity converted from sunlight by the photovoltaic panels and only a quarter of the electricity generated by the largest of Eigg’s three hydro-electric turbines.   

The mundane, everyday work involved in running the island’s energy infrastructure is even less visible. Visitors rarely see the activity that takes place out of sight, hidden from view, like the 11km of buried high voltage aluminium cable that carries electricity around the island.

##Down by the Pier

Saturday afternoon, down by the pier. On the flaking wooden benches outside the Isle of Eigg’s general store, a few people gather in the late afternoon sun, enjoying a few weekend drinks. Kenny Kean, also known as Bean, doesn’t join them. “I’m off the drink tonight,’ he says, ‘It's my night doing the checks. Maybe I'll reward myself with a G&T tomorrow night instead".

Bean leaves the pier and drives his 4x4 up to the Solar Station. 

Bean was Eigg Electric’s first Team Leader. Today the role is rotated every three years. 

The five member Eigg Electric team brings together people with a diverse range of skills and experience, and together they are able to perform advanced diagnostic and repair work on the electricity system. 

Bean was formerly maintenance worker with Lochaber Housing Association responsible for looking after the electricity supply and diesel generators in the island’s council buildings. Another team member, Bob, works as a boat engineer for Greenpeace. 

‘We're very fortunate to have such a skilled team - people with different backgrounds and different experiences, says Jenny Robertson, the only woman on the team. ‘Bean has been involved since day one, and he knows the system inside out. Eddie's a great team leader, his personality suits it, he gets the best out of people, he knows how to keep everyone on board. Bob used to work with huge engines on the Greenpeace boats. He really knows his stuff. You can trust him, absolutely trust him. If Bob says something needs doing, you know it needs doing. Jamie’s really strong, he's keen, he learns quickly, and he’s reliable.’

##The Generator Backup

One of the daily tasks is to check the generators. Eigg Electric keeps two generators in service. 

![Alt text](/offgrid-eigg/offgrid/img/saturday/kennyweb.jpg)

Long term Eigg residents with family in the Scottish highlands share stories of brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, who have gone without electricity for days at a time following big storms. Blackouts are rare on Eigg.

One of the daily tasks is to check the generators. Eigg Electric keeps two generators in service. 

![Alt text](/offgrid-eigg/offgrid/img/saturday/generatorsweb.jpg)

The generators are set to automatically kick when there is increased demand for electricity or if the system fails. The system switches from one generator to the other after every two hundred hours of use. 

![Alt text](/offgrid-eigg/offgrid/img/saturday/generatorscloseweb.jpg)

Every day somebody has to check the ‘hours used’ reading on the generator. If the generators have remained ‘off’ since the last check, then it is clear that the main hydroelectric system has been running without any problems. This Saturday the generator in use read, 3360.6. By Monday, two days, later it had increased to 3368.6.
