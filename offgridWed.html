##Legacy Infrastructure
```

```
Bob cycles to the control centre along the jagged-stone-cobbled track that leads east from The Lodge, where he lives, past the now-demolished old white 'volunteers house', and through the fields surrounding Sandamhor Farm, before joining the road and the junction just down from the post-box - then on to the Solar Station to carry out the daily checks.

Until 1997 when a community buyout saw the island’s ownership transferred to its residents the lodge was home to the 9th Laird of Eigg, Keith Schellenberg. 

A small dam was first built here in the 1920s and once supplied an ageing 8kw hydro-electric turbine capable.

The system lay unused for years, until Eigg’s community buyout. Over the past fifteen year’s this old energy infrastructure has been refurbished, refashioned and rebuilt.

##Renovations
```

```
When Bob and Norah moved into the old Lodge they looked into installing solar-heating systems, drawing on their contacts in the renewable energy sector for funding, design and feasibility advice. ‘Back then - just a few years ago now - the units were too expensive - we had so much work to do on the building, on the back buildings too - it was going to be too much money to arrange it just for here, for one building at a time." Bob used the hydro-electric unit only occasionally, running it at full capacity whenever the dam was full so that he could use his high-draw electric power tools. 

Today the Lodge is better know as the [Earth Connections Eco Centre] (http://www.earthconnections.co.uk/]), an international centre for residential courses in environmental sustainability. Just behind The Lodge is a long bike shed, with enough refurbished bicycles inside to cater to the larger groups who come here for courses in permaculture, gardening, yoga, low-energy living, beekeeping, nature-watching, alternatives to mainstream consumerism, human ecology, sea life, renewable energy, dance and seasonal food.

The founding of Eigg Electric created new impetus and resources for renovating this old infrastructure. Eigg Electric have strengthened the dam, refurbished the outlet and replaced the generator.

This unit now forms one of three hydro plants on Eigg. Whilst its overall input to Eigg's mini-grid has little impact on the overall amount of energy available at any one time the contribution of these two smaller Hydro-electric units helped Eigg Electric generate income under the UK’s Feed in Tarrif Scheme.

##Proprietary Technologies
```

As an Eigg Electric team member Bob draws on his experience as engineer or chief engineer on Greenpeace.
. ‘He's used to working on great, huge ship engines, diesel engines just a tiny bit bigger than our generators,’ says Bean. ‘He never misses a thing.” 

Bob is modest about his own skills. “There are some of us who have some familiarity with engines,’ he acknowledges, ‘and if we need to fix the generators there's a lot we can do ourselves".

But, as he explains, some parts of the island’s energy system are closed technologies, that demand licenced items of equipment to open or maintain. ‘Some of the specific parts, especially in the turbines, are proprietary and you need specific tools - only for certain jobs - so sometimes we have to call out an engineer.’
