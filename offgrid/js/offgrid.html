## At the Pier

![Alt text](img/day1/1-1.jpg)

Down by the pier, on the flaking wooden benches outside the Isle of Eigg’s general store, a few people gather in the late afternoon sun, enjoying a few drinks. Kenny Kean, also known as Bean, doesn’t join them. “I’m off the drink tonight,’ he says, ‘It's my night doing the checks. Maybe I'll reward myself with a G&T tomorrow night instead".

The Eigg Electric maintenance team members take it in turns to carry out daily checks on the system, once in the evening and once the following morning.

##  Kenny Kean (aka Bean)
![Alt text](img/day1/2-1.jpg)
Bean was Eigg Electric’s first Team Leader. Today the role is rotated every three years. 

The five member Eigg Electric team brings together people with a diverse range of skills and experience, and together they are able to perform advanced diagnostic and repair work on the electricity system. 

Bean was formerly maintenance worker with Lochaber Housing Association responsible for looking after the electricity supply and diesel generators in the island’s council buildings. Another team member, Bob, was a boat engineer for Greenpeace. 

‘We're very fortunate to have such a skilled team - people with different backgrounds and different experiences, says Jenny Robertson, the only woman on the team. ‘Bean has been involved since day one, and he knows the system inside out. Eddie's a great team leader, his personality suits it, he gets the best out of people, he knows how to keep everyone on board. Bob used to work with huge engines on the Greenpeace boats. He really knows his stuff. You can trust him, absolutely trust him. If Bob says something needs doing, you know it needs doing. Jamie’s really strong, he's keen, he learns quickly, and he’s reliable.’

##  The Generator Back Up
![Alt text](img/day1/3-1.jpg)
Bean leaves the pier and drives his 4x4 up to the Solar Station. 

Eigg’s electricity system combines diverse sources of power (wind, hydro, solar and diesel) to maintain a near constant supply of electricity. 

Long term Eigg residents with family in the Scottish highlands share stories of brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, who have gone without electricity for days at a time following big storms. 
![Alt text](img/day1/3-2.jpg)
One of the daily tasks is to check the generators. Eigg Electric keeps two generators in service. 
![Alt text](img/day1/3-3.jpg)
The generators are set to automatically kick when there is increased demand for electricity or if the system fails. The system switches from one generator to the other after every two hundred hours of use. 
![Alt text](img/day1/3-4.jpg)
Every day somebody has to check the ‘hours used’ reading on the generator. If the generators have remained ‘off’ since the last check, then it is clear that the main hydroelectric system has been running without any problems.

This Wednesday the generator in use read, 3360.6. Two days later it had increased to 3368.6.

##  The Contaminated Fuel Mystery
![Alt text](img/day1/4-1.jpg)
In 2013 the failure of both of Eigg’s generators led to a rare power outage.

The Eigg Electric team worked quickly to try and diagnose the problem. They replaced each generator’s fuel filter. This was enough to get one of the generators working again. But the other continued to fail. 

Thee Glasgow company who had supplied Eigg Electric with both generators quoted an extraordinary price to send out an engineer, £30 per hour from the moment he left their Glasgow headquarters, plus expenses and parts. 

Instead they decided to hire and ship a replacement generator from the mainland. ‘It probably cost us three grand,’ says Bean. ‘Easily. But we thought we had to, really".

The team continued to try and fix the generator. They checked fuel supplies for contaminants, like water, and sent samples off for testing.

When the first generator failed again they suspected a fault with the fuel pump. They replaced the pump, re-built the generator and tested it. At first it seemed to work but soon failed again. The team were stumped. 

Whilst continuing to use the hired machine as the island's main generator they sent the defunct fuel-pump away to a specialist on the mainland for analysis. When the report came back it identified traces of contamination, not visible but enough to cause both fuel pumps to stop functioning and both generators to fail.

Despite the team's extensive checks, they were unable to identify the source of contamination. They flushed and re-piped all fuel supplies to the generators, and ran the fuel through special 1000 litre tanks or cubes that were shipped over specifically to check for contamination. 

![Alt text](img/day1/4-2.jpg)
Today a few of these fuel 'cubes' remain dotted outside the Solar Station, waiting to be fully used up, 

Today the mystery remains unsolved and Bean keeps his eyes open for second-hand, Lister Generators in classified ads and on eBay. ‘Lister Generators can run forever. You can pick one up quite cheap, maybe for a couple of grand. That would be worth it. Especially if you get one that has been sitting outside a hospital, they’s be ideal. They’d be really well maintained and would’ve hardly ever have been used, only in rare emergencies.’

Fixing the generators is no longer a priority but Bean remains on the look out for a good deal. ‘I know you can't cover everything! You can't second-guess everything that could ever happen, anything that could ever go wrong. That wouldn't make sense. You can’t have a backup of the backup of the backup! But an old Lister in decent condition…”
