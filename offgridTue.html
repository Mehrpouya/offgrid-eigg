Bean, his partner Sheena and their dog Duke leave their house by foot in the spring sunshine. 

![Alt text](/offgrid-eigg/offgrid/img/tuesday/beanhouseweb1.jpg)

Bean stops at the Solar Station for the morning check, Sheena carries on, to the doctor’s surgery where she works.

On his way back Bean will stop off at Sandamhor Cottage, a property that Bean and Sheena run as a holiday property with fellow residents Brian and Shirley. Brian and Shirley are away, driving their motorhome around Portugal, and Bean has some last-minute checks to carry out before new visitors arrive on the morning’s CalMac ferry.

##'The Flate Rate'
```

Bean grew up in Bishopbriggs, north Glasgow, and moved to Eigg in 1989. 

In his previous job as maintenance worker for Lochaber Housing Association he was responsible for the supply of electricity to all six of the association’s properties on Eigg. This included the former 'daycare centre’ and 5 council houses. These properties turned out to be a vital source of information for Eigg Electric.

Bean had access to energy-usage data for each of the council properties. He knew where the generator-supply was going, and that just one of the properties frequently used 50 per cent of the total power supplied to all six properties.

He realised the importance of controlling electricity consumption on Eigg and presented information from the council properties to the newly-formed EE team, asking if there was a way to better share the available electricity. 

One of Eigg Electric’s founding members, John Booth, went away and did some sums, and came back with a figure that limited each household to 5kw of electricity per day. 

The 5kw limit reduced the cost of cabling for the micro-grid itself, making it safer to use aluminium wire rather than more expensive copper cabling to link households to the micro-grid. 

With a flat rate charge of 23 pence per unit Eigg Electric is reputed to be one of the cheapest renewable energy providers in the UK. No other standalone system like this works out as cheap.

##The Contaminated Fuel Mystery
```

When Eigg's new electricity system was first installed there were teething problems. ‘During the first year,’ Bean remembers, ‘the generators seemed to always be running at maximum. They were really chugging, far too loud, as if something just hadn't been set up right, and there were clouds of black smoke whenever they started up. We’d check the engines, make sure everything was running ok, but why they ran like that we didn't know.’ 

In 2013 the failure of both of Eigg’s generators led to a rare power outage.

The Eigg Electric team worked quickly to try and diagnose the problem. They replaced each generator’s fuel filter. This was enough to get one of the generators working again. But the other continued to fail. 

Thee Glasgow company who had supplied Eigg Electric with both generators quoted an extraordinary price to send out an engineer, £30 per hour from the moment he left their Glasgow headquarters, plus expenses and parts. 

Instead they decided to hire and ship a replacement generator from the mainland. ‘It probably cost us three grand,’ says Bean. ‘Easily. But we thought we had to, really".

The team continued to try and fix the generator. They checked fuel supplies for contaminants, like water, and sent samples off for testing.

When the first generator failed again they suspected a fault with the fuel pump. They replaced the pump, re-built the generator and tested it. At first it seemed to work but soon failed again. The team were stumped. 

Whilst continuing to use the hired machine as the island's main generator they sent the defunct fuel-pump away to a specialist on the mainland for analysis. When the report came back it identified traces of contamination, not visible but enough to cause both fuel pumps to stop functioning and both generators to fail.

Despite the team's extensive checks, they were unable to identify the source of contamination. They flushed and re-piped all fuel supplies to the generators, and ran the fuel through special 1000 litre tanks or cubes that were shipped over specifically to check for contamination. Today a few of these fuel 'cubes' remain dotted outside the Solar Station, waiting to be fully used up.

Today the mystery remains unsolved and Bean keeps his eyes open for second-hand, Lister Generators in classified ads and on eBay. ‘Lister Generators can run forever. You can pick one up quite cheap, maybe for a couple of grand. That would be worth it. Especially if you get one that has been sitting outside a hospital, they’s be ideal. They’d be really well maintained and would’ve hardly ever have been used, only in rare emergencies.’

Fixing the generators is no longer a priority but Bean remains on the look out for a good deal. ‘I know you can't cover everything! You can't second-guess everything that could ever happen, anything that could ever go wrong. That wouldn't make sense. You can’t have a backup of the backup of the backup! But an old Lister in decent condition…”
