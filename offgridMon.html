On Monday morning Jenny walks over to the Solar Station, topping up the diesel generator with a small amount of engine oil.

She takes a longer route back home to give her dog, Harry, some exercise.

Like others, Jenny’s business has benefited enormously from the island’s broadband access and the access it provides to online social media. Though Jenny doesn’t use Facebook to keep in touch with friends on a day-to-day basis, she has made good use of them to promote A'nead Knitwear, and she does what she can to promote her neighbours. “Other people are so good at re-tweeting things, events, fairs, everything on Eigg - I sometimes feel guilty - but I do what I can "liking" things - everyone's activities and posts from here - on Facebook and things.”


#Monday, am
##Recognition

Jenny returns to her kitchen, overlooking the pier, with a view south-south-east across to the mainland.

On her window-sill sit three jars, part of Jenny's recent experiment with ‘solar dyeing’, producing new natural colours to use in the fine-knitted products she sells through her business A'nead Knitwear. 

One jar has nettles and merino wool suspended in water, the other two combine yellow gorse flowers with angora fibre. Jenny spun the merino wool on her own spinning wheel, an item made in the Scottish borders with local wood. The spinning wheel has transformed the kind, and amount, of work she can create and her business is growing: "I might even reach the tax threshold this year - I can't wait till I can pay tax!" 

Small businesses like Jenny’s are flourishing on Eigg. “Before, there were people on the dole long-term, not many opportunities…You really see now the opposite of that. More and more people setting up there own concerns."
 
One initiative, [EiggBox] (http://www.eiggbox.com/]) , a social enterprise that aims to support creative activity, entrepreneurship, inspiration and collaboration has done much to promote the island's real and virtual networks, linking small businesses and artists on Eigg to other people and communities across the Highlands and Islands.   

But it’s not just the networks that have been so significant. It’s also, as Jenny puts it, ‘the recognition’. ‘It makes a real difference for people to feel their work is recognised as 'work' and as something to be promoted, and shared."
