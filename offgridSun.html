##Learning From Eigg

Early on Sunday morning Bean returns to the pier. He locks his car. ‘I wouldn't do that normally,’ he said. But today he has picked up some boxes of pharmaceuticals in his car to drop off at the medical centre later.

![you didn't include the picture for medical web!'](offgrid/img/sunday/medicalweb.jpg)

The island’s health centre has its own backup generator for use in power outages and the refridgeration systems, in which drugs are kept cold, are fitted with alarms. If they are without power for a fixed period of time (approximately three hours) then the alarm sounds, and all the drugs have to be thrown away and destroyed. 

"They don't pay anyone to maintain the generator,’ Bean says, ‘They have insurance for that. Insurance to replace any drugs that have to be thrown away.’ Unlike Eigg Electric - which can depend upon the skills and specialised knowledge of its team members - the health board demands that service providers, including diesel mechanics, be formerly registered. 

‘It's all down to the legalities - they can't use anyone who isn't on certain lists. If you work on Council property, or for the Health Board, you've got be registered with this, that and the other… I can’t mend the surgery’s generator… they just pay the insurance instead."

For long term residents of Eigg being off grid offers no escape from government, and people frequently complain about the impact of rules and regulations on the construction and maintenance of buildings or of employment.

"Ten, fifteen years ago, we could do whatever we wanted here - not any more though, things are more and more limited - all these legalities.’

For some people there is a shift in perspective, with local authorities and policy makers becoming more attentive to the importance and benefits of infrastructure that is locally designed and installed.

‘That idea that one size fits all - it only works if what people are actually using, actually doing, is considered,’ explains Bean. ‘I think the mainland's beginning to learn from communities like us. Beginning to adopt our innovations. Our systems are more reliable and cheaper in the long run.’

The island is swathed in a thick mist. The rain drizzles down.

Just before 5pm, after she has finished her Sunday stint working in the Craft Shop at the Pier, Jenny Robertson leaves her house to carry out her checks at the control centre. As she does everyday, she makes the journey on foot, so that she can take her dog, Harry, out out for a walk. 

Originally from South Africa, Jenny spent a few years on Eigg in the mid 1990s before returning in 2004. Like most people on Eigg Jenny has several jobs. She runs a small business, [A’nead Knitwear] (http://www.anead-knitwear.co.uk/]) and works in the craft shop, alongside her work with the Eigg Electric team. 

Meanwhile, Bean works a few hours a week at the school doing maintenance, and takes on grass-cutting jobs in the Spring and Summer: "I love my life cutting grass’, he says, ‘the smell of petrol in the morning.’ Bob runs The Lodge, an eco-education centre, with his partner Nora and their three sons. Meanwhile Eddie is a crofter and has sells some of his produce, including packets of bluebell seeds, online. 
 
‘Once you have decided you want to live here,’ Jenny says, ‘You can find a way if you want to.’

At the Solar Station Jenny meets Bean who has arranged to drive her to the wooden hut near Laig Farm where the hydroelectric turbine is housed. 

After a night and day of cloud and rain, the Eigg Electric team thinks there should be sufficient water in the stream to restart the hydroelectric system back on. The hydroelectric system had been manually shut down the previous week, as the flow of water in the stream slowed.’ ‘Despite all the rain we get,’ Bean explains, ‘this place can go from dry-as-a-bone to soaking just like that, in no time at all…One minute it's so dry you're seeing cracks in the ground, in the soil. And then the rain comes down, there are muddy, puddles everywhere and then you’re flooded. You can see for yourself, some of the streams can dry up very quickly, then be gushing the next minute’.

From the junction at the southern end of Cleadale, they turn off the road onto the track that leads to Laig Farm. The road is pitted, slow and full of puddles. ‘It’s hard on vehicles, if you're doing it everyday,’ says Bean.

In the 4x4 Bean and Jenny share jokes and stories. They gossip about a recent land-deal and they talk about the coming of spring. Cuckoos have been heard across the island in the last few days, and they list the time and place of each reported hearing. Jenny contrasts this year’s weather with the last year’s early spring and laughs at the inability of city folk to recall whether spring came early or late. The arrival of spring and its signs varies greatly across Eigg. Daffodils flower a month later on the north side of the island, which is sheltered from the morning and midday sun in the spring, than on the south side.

##New Buildings

They drive past a new wood-frame cottage that is being built as a holiday home by the residents of Laig Farm, George and Saira, who are looking to diversify their own income. Saira runs a catering company, Eiggy Bread, and they hope the cottage will be another earner. There used to be two caravans on the site. The caravans had never been fully secured and one year, in a particularly strong gale, they were blown away, over a rocky outcrop. The  cottage is set back from the beach, with its view across the sea to Rum, and is hidden from view by the rocky outcrop. ‘I think it must be one of the best sites in Cleadale,’ says George, ‘the emptiness…the seclusion.’

There was an old septic tank on the site - a herringbone tank filtering straight into the beck or stream, under the road and into the sea, which is only metres away - but the new dwelling cannot use this. Current building regulations require a modern septic tank and waste disposal system. Building regulations also govern how the new cottage will be supplied with water. ‘The rain falls on the roof,’ George explains. ‘It's just rain, you could drink it. It goes into a pipe, into the beck, and that's that. But to do this, I need written permission from the Landlord, which is the Eigg Trust. So, to move clean water from here to here, a distance of only about 20 feet, I need to drive to the office, meet the secretary of the Trust in the office, get her to sign it and everything, all for the sake of what? There are so many regulations and we haven't even started on the things that really matter, like what kind of shower are we going to have’.

##Telephone Cables

They pass a length of unearthed, rusty and warped cabling sticking up from the ground at the edge of the Laig Bay beach. This is part of an old phone line that connected the small isles. ‘The phone line wasn't buried, Bean explains, ‘it just ran down the hillside here, across the beach, and into the sea, over to Rum and from there, I think, on to Skye and beyond. The newer ones were buried properly’. 

![Alt text](offgrid/img/sunday/bridgeweb.jpg)
There is a gate across the track where it crosses a rickety wooden bridge. Bean remembers coming for parties at Laig Farm when George's grandmother, Peggy, and family lived here. He used to drive up and down in a beat-up old transit van with his pal, DJ. ‘We could hit about 45 miles per hour on this track.’ 

The bump their way to the end of the track, get out of the 4x4 and cross a small slatted footbridge to the Hydro Hut.

##Restarting the Hydro

Bean unlocks the hut and sets to, switching levers to redirect the water flow back through the turbines. 

If the turbine shuts down automatically because there is a fault it is more complicated to restart, requiring more steps and specific knowledge of the software or operating system. But when the turbine has been shut down manually, restarting it is straightforward. 

###### <iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/109570884?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=3a6774&amp;autoplay=0&amp;loop=1" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

Jenny and Bean watch the display panel, waiting for the reading to show the generator is active and the accompanying shift in sound. Bean listens carefully to the main bearing unit on the turbine. There is more whine than normal and the unit is currently running at a hotter temperature than it should, 50-55 degrees as opposed to the normal running temperature of 25-30. 

###### <iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/110627215?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=3a6774&amp;autoplay=0&amp;loop=1" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

In the past re-greasing the unit has fixed the problem and made the temperature drop. But the team have already done this a few times and the temperature has stopped falling back to normal. The team anticipates that it is going to need replacing in the coming weeks. They have already purchased a replacement unit, at a cost of about £1100, and it is ready to be installed whenever they need it. ‘We might as well wait and get all the life out of this old one while we can though,’ Bean explains, ‘these things aren't cheap.’

The Eigg Electric team can save further costs by installing replacements like this one themselves. Their ability to do so often come down to the tools required. Sometimes there are very particular links and access-points, it depends what tools we would need. We might need an engineer from the supply company to visit and do the work - the bearing units and their installation are precise - it's one of the most important parts of the Hydro itself, we'll have to have a look at first though."

For now, however, everything goes smoothly. Over the next 24 hours the hydroelectric turbine generates sufficient additional power to the grid that the diesel generators do not kick in.
